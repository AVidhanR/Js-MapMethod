# MapMethod
This repo is about how map method works

The map() method in JavaScript is a higher-order function used to transform elements of an array. 
It takes a callback function as an argument and applies that function to each item in the array, creating a new array with the results. 

> The syntax is:
js``` const newArray = array.map(callback(element, index, array) => {
  // return transformed element
}); ```

The callback function is executed for every element, and the transformed values are collected in a new array. 
This is a powerful tool for efficiently manipulating data within arrays, making it a fundamental part of modern JavaScript programming,
often used for tasks like data transformation, filtering, and rendering lists in web applications.
